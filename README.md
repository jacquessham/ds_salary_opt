<h1>Data Scientist Salary Across United States</h1>

In this project, I am interested to know the salary across United States. Since it is not possible to obtain the salary of Data Scientist but we can use the salary from H1B Visa application to know how much do employers pay to Data Scientists.<br>
<br>
We can obtain the data in the H1B Salary Database provided by Department of Labor. But it does not provide an api or csv files for us to download. If we have the link, we can scrape the html of this page with Beautifulsoup. After we have prepared the data, we can visualize with Plotly.
<br> 
Note that the data is just approximatation.
